## 🚀 Quick Overview

👉 This project enables **Home Assistant** to monitor data of a **UGOS based UGreen NAS** - *without modifying its operating system in any way*. No extra tools/scripts are installed in UGOS, no ssh access with cryptic shell commands is needed; we simply use what UGOS already provides.
